# 🧠 Stress Level Prediction API

A Machine Learning API built using FastAPI to predict stress levels based on workplace and lifestyle factors.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a trained Machine Learning model to classify stress levels into:

- Low Stress
- Medium Stress
- High Stress

The API is deployed as a production-ready web service.

## 🌐 Live API

- **Swagger UI:** [View Documentation](https://stress-api-i2ig.onrender.com)
- **Base URL:** `https://stress-api-i2ig.onrender.com`

> **Note:** This API is hosted on a free Render instance. If it has been inactive, the first request may take ~30 seconds to "wake up."
